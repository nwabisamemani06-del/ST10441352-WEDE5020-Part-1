        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>This business was founded in 2019 by Nwabisa Faith Memani. 
          Business sales started generating online on social media platforms like Tik-Tok and Facebook
            where we got the name of the business as well.</p>

            <h2>Mission and Vision</h2>
            <p>The mission of Sneaker Mode is to grow their community and online presence, 
                possibly throughout Port Elizabeth, London, UK and Cape Town while our objective is to become a premier location 
                for the purchase, sale, and trading of high-end sneakers and streetwear.</p> 
                
                <p> <strong>Vision</strong> Sneaker Mode envisions a future where we, as a company, are a significant player in the sneaker and streetwear industry,
                broadening our impact and presence. This involves expanding our own digital footprint, possibly opening stores in new areas
                 (such as Central London, or throughout the UK and Europe)</p>
